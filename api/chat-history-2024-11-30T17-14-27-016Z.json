    "content": "Web3 refers to the third generation of the World Wide Web, built on blockchain technology and decentralized networks. It focuses on decentralization, democratization, and transparency, providing users with more control over their data, transactions, and digital assets.\n\nKey features of Web3 include:\n\n1. **Decentralized**: No central authority controls the network.\n2. **Blockchain**: Transactions are recorded on a public ledger (blockchain).\n3. **Smart contracts**: Self-executing contracts with automated rules and protocols.\n4. **Cryptocurrencies**: Digital currencies, such as Ethereum's Ether (ETH), enable secure payments.\n5. **Decentralized applications (dApps)**: User-generated software built on blockchain platforms.\n\nWeb3 aims to provide a more secure, transparent, and efficient way of interacting with digital information and services, enabling new use cases and opportunities for individuals and organizations."
